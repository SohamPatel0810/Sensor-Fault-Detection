# Sensor-Fault-Detection
The datasets positive class corresponds to component failures for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class corresponds to trucks with failures for components not related to the APS system.  The problem is to reduce the cost due to unnecessary repairs. So it is required to minimize the false predictions.
